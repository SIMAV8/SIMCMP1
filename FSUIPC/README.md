VB.net 2013 Project
-------------------
Source code to drive SIMCMP1 hardware in VB.net version 2013 using serial over USB to Arduino and FSUIPC

Use
---
You DON'T need VB.net to use this version of the interface!!!  There's a fully compiled and ready to run version, complete with Don Henty's interface, in https://github.com/SIMAV8/SIMCMP1/tree/master/FSUIPC/SIMcmp1_fsuipc/bin/Release.   Download that entire Release folder, you can rename it from Release to whatever you like, but .NET requires all the files to be together in the folder in order for the application to run.  Dot NET Framework 4.5 was used, you may need to download or Windows Update to that version...

Requires
